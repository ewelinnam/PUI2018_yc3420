# Citibike Review for Antonio Kodsy.

## A.  
The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are stated correctly.  
However, it will be better if avoid the typo and use “Alternative hypothesis” rather than just “hypothesis”. 
Moreover, it will be more reasonable if using “average trip duration” in the statement.   

## B.
The dataset is successfully downloaded and cleaned. 
Both the trip duration and gender data are in the cleaned dataframe 
which could support further analysis.  There are three number in gender 
(1, 2, and 0) while 0 = unknown, it is important to drop it from the dataset.   

## C. 
According to the flow chart of choosing stat test type, 
the T test could be utilized in this case since there are two numerical sample sets involved.   

## More Suggestions?
It will be better if you could add a histogram that shows the sample distribution. 
Because there are too many sample points, 
some characters might not be clear when using scatter plot of gender vs trip duration .
